# Logistic Neuron

The matemathic architecture of the logistic neuron is the logistic function 
(logit) that belongs to the sigmoid functions family. This neuron is utilized 
to do both binary clasifications {0,1} (a class) and also for doing probabilities 
regression [0,1].  

I included two datasets for doing binary classifications, one  is of cancer 
and no cancer cells and the other dataset is a dataset of people with diabetes. 


In demo.py I made some predictions with the data above mentioned.
